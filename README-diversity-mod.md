## What Is It?

Diversity Mod is a mod that gives the D6 and 3 random passive items to all characters. It allows for more diversity when racing.

<br />

## Exact Changes

* All characters start with the D6 (except for Eve, Eden, and Keeper, as it isn't possible).
* All characters start with the same 3 additional random passive items, keeping their original passive items and resources.
* Mom's Knife, Epic Fetus, and Tech X are removed from all item pools. It is still possible to start with them as one of the 3 passive items.
* D4 and D100 are removed from all item pools.
* All special items are no longer special.
* Room modifications, animations, and bug fixes are taken from [the Jud6s mod](https://github.com/Zamiell/jud6s).
