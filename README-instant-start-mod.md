## What Is It?

* This is a mod that gives racers the same starting item. The idea is that it is a compromise between seeded and unseeded racing.
* Other than that, it uses the same files as [the Jud6s mod](https://github.com/Zamiell/jud6s).
* It includes the 19 best starting items from item rooms. It also provides the option to use [other starts](https://github.com/Zamiell/instant-start-mod/blob/master/otherFiles/builds.xml), like Maw of the Void, Sacred Heart, and others.

<br />

## Rules

* You are not allowed to take the item from the Basement 1 Treasure Room. (The idea of the mod is to eliminate resetting over and over. Without this rule, it would still be a good idea to reset for a *second* starting item.)

<br />

## How Do I Use It?

Much like Diversity Mod, all you have to do is run the `instant-start-mod` program. You do not have to move any files or uninstall other mods. To change the starting item, you have to close the game between runs and relaunch it using the program.
